Demonstrate the Principles of an Effective Debrief
--------------------------------------

| This objective seeks to instill the concept of mission debrief into all AFROTC training activities with a goal of building a culture of learning through shared experience. At a minimum, FTP cadets must be able to effectively lead a team debrief in order to obtain the P1 proficiency level.
 
**P2 Proficiency Level**

| Requires cadets to be able to debrief training events by facilitating group discussion, recalling points of failure and/or success, and identifying learning points.
 
**P3 Proficiency Level**

| The P3 level of proficiency requires cadets to fully appreciate the concept of effective debrief and how it ties to future mission success, identify root cause, pinpoint catalysts for success, and capture critical learning points from the activity. Qualified P3 cadets will also be able to effectively evaluate cadet-led debriefs while fostering continued growth in subordinates.
 
**Additional Information:**

| Cadets commonly mistake end-of-scenario feedback for debriefs. However, while feedback is primarily focused on the individual being evaluated, debrief is the team’s opportunity to openly discuss “how” the mission was executed, drill down to the root cause for any issues that occurred during the mission, and focus on areas of learning to help propel the team to future success. The debrief process is deeply rooted in the aviation community, however, the concepts can be applied cross-functionally. The instructor should strive to tie the value of candid and constructive debriefs as a foundational element of continued officer professional development and mission accomplishment.

**Debrief Focal Point (DFP) [WHY]:**

* Outwardly Focused
* Mission Impact of your Actions
* RESULT of what you did or did not do
 
**Contributing Factor (CF):**

* WHAT you did or did not do
* Assessed by asking why your actions impacted the mission
 
**Root Cause (RC)[WHAT]:**

* Ultimate factor or origin of failure that resulted in DFP
* Chosen from CF
 
**Instructional Fix (IF)[HOW]:**

* Course of action to prevent your RC during next mission
* HOW you changed
 
**Lessons Learned (LL):**

* WHEN - During…
* WHAT - I will not [RC]...
* HOW - By doing [IF]
* WHY - So that [DFP] does not happen
