Change of Command Procedure
-----------------------------

The primary purpose of a change of command ceremony is to allow subordinates to witness the formality of command change from one officer to another. Therefore, the ceremony should be official, formal, brief and conducted with great dignity. |br| 

If the higher echelon commander desires, the change of command may be performed off and in front of the reviewing stand. This is done to enable everyone to actually see the former commander and new commander relinquish and assume command, respectively. |br|
    
At a parade ceremony attended by the higher echelon commander, the order directing the change of command is read after the presentation of decorations and award, if scheduled. Otherwise, the order is read after the national anthem and officers center portion in the normal review sequence. |br|
    
After the order is read, the flag/guidon is exchanged during the change of command as a symbolic gesture providing a tangible view of the command authority being transferred from one commander to the next. The sequence for the exchange begins with three participants standing abreast, from left to right as viewed from the audience, presiding officer, outgoing commander, and incoming commander. A fourth participant, the flag/guidon bearer, takes a position behind and between presiding officer and outgoing commander. The flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued command, “Officers, Center;” the presiding officer executes a left face while the two commanders execute a right face. The outgoing commander salutes the presiding officer, while stating, “Sir/Ma’am, I relinquish command.” The presiding officer returns salute. The outgoing commander takes the flag/guidon from the flag/guidon bearer, holding the flag/guidon angling the top of flag/guidon towards the head of the flag/guidon bearer, and presents it to the presiding officer, presiding officer hands on top. The outgoing commander takes one step to the right, two steps back and one step to the left; simultaneously, the incoming commander takes two steps forward, taking the outgoing commander’s place. The presiding officer presents the flag/guidon to the incoming commander who firmly receives the flag/guidon and passes it to the flag/guidon bearer. The incoming commander salutes the presiding officer, while stating, “Sir/Ma’am, I assume command.” The presiding officer returns the salute. The flag/guidon bearer gives a subdued command, “Officers, Post.” All three officers face forward. |br|
    
The Commander of Troops then directs the formation to be brought to present arms and presents the command to the higher echelon commander, who directs the march in review. The higher echelon commander, former commander, or new commander may take one step forward to accept the pass in review. |br|
   
The flagbearers may change positions at the same time and in the same manner as their respective commanders. |br|
    
The ceremony should be performed after the Colors are brought forward for the national anthem, whether it is a parade or a review sequence (change of command only). |br|
   
If no decorations are awarded, the higher echelon commander directs the Commander of Troops to have the Colors come forward. Once the Colors and Commander of Troops are in place, the former and new commanders march out to a position between the Colors and Commander of Troops. The Commander of Troops salutes and reports Sir (Ma’am), the Colors are present. The Commander of Troops then returns to his or her original position and gives the Airmen present arms for the national anthem. After the national anthem, order arms, and parade rest, the narrator begins to read the order. |br|
  
The higher echelon commander steps off the reviewing stand and moves to a position directly in front of the former commander. |br|
    
When salutes have been exchanged, the higher echelon commander directs the new and former commanders to join him or her on the reviewing stand. All three commanders move to their right and return to the reviewing stand to face the Airmen, with the new commander to the higher echelon commander’s left and the former commander to the new commander’s left. |br|
    
The Colors return to their original position once the commanders depart for the reviewing stand. Once the colors are in position, the Commander of Troops salutes the higher echelon commander without a report. The higher echelon commander exchanges salutes and directs MARCH THE COMMAND IN REVIEW. |br|

Award Ceremonies
------------------------
    
The presentation of decorations and awards to military or civilian personnel and the appending of unit decoration streamers, battle honors, and service streamers onto an Air Force organizational flag are made at a parade. The same parade may honor persons and units who are to be decorated or receive awards and persons who are retiring. |br|

Persons to be decorated are positioned before the start of the ceremony on the right side of the reviewing stand. They line up in columns according to rank of the decorations to be conferred, with the highest-ranking decoration in front. |br|

After the command has been presented, the reviewing officer instructs the Commander of Troops to have the persons to be decorated (receive awards, etc.) and the Colors brought forward. |br|

The Commander of Troops passes around the right flank of the detachment and proceeds directly to the normal post. On reaching the post, he or she brings the Airmen to present arms, faces about, and brings the staff to present arms. The band then plays the national anthem or To The Colors. On completion of the music, the Commander of Troops brings the staff to order arms, faces about, and brings the Airmen to order arms and parade rest. On the command of the senior flagbearer, the persons to be decorated (receive awards, etc.) and the color guard come to present arms for the national anthem or To The Colors. When the music ceases, they execute order arms on the command. |br|

The citation or order announcing the awards is read. As the citation (order) is read, the reviewing officer and staff (or certain members of the staff) advance to the flags and the line of persons to be decorated. The reviewing officer fastens the streamer immediately below the staff ornament of the flagstaff. |br|
