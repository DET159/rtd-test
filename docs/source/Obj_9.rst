**Entrance Procedures**

#. Flights will arrive no more than 3 minutes before or after their scheduled dining priorities.
#. The Cadet Flt/CC will note the time they initially halt the flight in front of the dining hall as their official arrival time. (For example, if a flight has to wait for another flight to clear the bay area, they will still annotate their initial halting time as their official arrival time.)
#. Cadet Flt/CCs are responsible for coordinating with other Cadet Flt/CCs awaiting entry to ensure they do not skip or make another flight late by arriving out of their 6-minute arrival window.
#. The Cadet Flt/CC is responsible for checking in with mess checker.
#. They halt the flight, place them at parade rest, and then take the most direct and unobstructed route to within no closer than six feet in front of the mess checker, halt, initiate a salute and say, **"Sir/Ma'am, __Flight reports. Our accountability is _ of __."** 
#. The mess checker returns the salute and either clears the flight to enter or directs the Cadet Flt/CC to standby. 
#. Once permitted to enter, the Cadet Flt/CC will ask, **"Will that be all, Sir/Ma'am?"** salute, return to the flight, and direct the flight to enter the dining facility with normal building entrance procedures. 
#. The mess checker and cadet reporting-in do not need to interrupt their reporting procedures to greet and salute commissioned staff. 
#. Cadets must wash their hands, or at a minimum use hand sanitizer, prior to entering the DFAC.

**Dining Facility Procedures**

#. While moving throughout the DFAC, cadets will limit talking to only de-conflicting movements (e.g. “excuse me”) and providing necessary responses to Officers or dining facility staff.
#. Cadets may pass each other in the serving area if they are not waiting for the same food items.
#. Cadets must execute proper situational awareness to ensure that they do not run into or obstruct the path of one another while moving through the dining facility. (NOTE: Cadets will not square corners while carrying trays, but will square corners in non-carpeted areas if unencumbered). 
#. The Cadet Flt/CD will be the first to process through the chow line, and the Cadet Flt/CC will be the last.
#. If a cadet needs to use the restroom, they will proceed directly to the restroom once they’ve entered the DFAC. Upon exiting the restroom, rejoin the line.
#. Do not perform facing movements while in the serving line or while carrying a tray. You will sidestep through the entire serving line (heels together when halted).
#. Once halted in position, cadets will center and ground their tray to the front edge of the table, and the stand in the position of attention. Cadets will remain at attention until the table is filled or a reasonable amount of time (~20 seconds) has passed.
#. The last cadet to arrive will stand at attention and give the command, **“Be seated.”**
#. Once seated, cadets in positions 2 and 3 will pass a napkin to cadets in positions 1 and 4 and then take one for themselves. Each cadet will place their napkin on their lap.
#. Cadets will sit at modified attention with back straight (not resting on the chair back) and shoulders squared.
#. Elbows will not be placed on the table or chair arms.
#. Cadets may bend forward at the waist and look down while eating to prevent spilling food.
#. Cadets will not converse with one another at the table.
#. If a cadet wishes to reach a condiment (salt, pepper, etc.) he or she will state, **“Pardon my reach”.** If the item is outside of the cadet’s reach, another cadet at the table will assist passing the item to the first cadet.
#. Additionally, cadets may answer questions which are directed to them by staff or dining facility personnel.
#. The last cadet to have arrived will state, **“Moment of silence”** (to accommodate those who wish to pray before their meal).
#. When everyone at the table is ready, the same cadet will state **“Enjoy your meal.”**
#. Cadets have 10 minutes to eat their meal. Time begins when, **“Enjoy your meal”** is stated and ends when trays are removed from the table.
#. The cadet that is timing the meal will place his or her watch on the center of table once started.
#. Cadets will place a napkin on top of the tray to signify they are finished with the meal.
#. Once everyone at the table has finished eating (all occupants of the table have napkins on their tray), cadets in positions 2 and 3 will pass all the items from their trays to cadets in positions 1 and 4.
#. Glasses will be placed on the trays upside down, but will not be stacked.
#. Trays will be stacked and carried to the cabinets by two when possible. If there are three cadets, one cadet will carry his/her own tray. If a cadet is unable to carry the tray due to restrictions, the other cadets will make the appropriate adjustments to carry the tray.
#. Once trays are stacked, cadets will stand, don their hydration systems, ground the chairs to the right side of the table, and then momentarily assume the position of attention.
#. The cadet in position 1 will proceed to the tray cabinet. The cadet in position 3 will lift the napkin holder while the cadet in position 2 wipes down the table. The cadet in position 4 will wait to collect any waste left over from cleaning and then proceed to the tray cabinet.

**Departure Procedures**

#. Upon exiting, cadets will form details and transit to the flight's designated form-up location. 
#. Once the guidon has been retrieved and five or more cadets have arrived at the form up location, the cadet flight commander, or a designated representative, will give the command, **"FALL IN".** 
#. Cadets will be in a detail or flight and at the position of attention or parade rest at all times.
#. Cadets will not talk unless making on-the-spot corrections.

Classroom Procedures
--------------------------------
 
**Opening Procedures**

#. Prior to the instructor entering the flight room, the Cadet Flt/CC will stand at parade rest in the front of the room, facing the back. 
#. All other cadets will be at parade rest behind their chairs. 
#. As the instructor breaks the threshold of the doorway, the Cadet Flt/CC will assume the position of attention and call the room to attention. 
#. The instructor will command, **“Take your seats.”** Cadets will then quickly take their seats and sit at the seated position of attention until placed **“At ease”** by the instructor.
 
**Closing Procedures**

#. Once the instructor indicates they are ready to close class, the Cadet Flt/CC will immediately stand, push in their chair, assume the position of attention behind their chair, and command, “Flight, prepare for dismissal.” 
#. Flight members will then stand, push in their chair, standardize training materials and assume the position of parade rest behind their chair. 
#. The Cadet Flt/CC will then maneuver to the front of the room and face the back of the room. 
#. The Cadet Flt/CC will assume the position of attention and then call the room to attention. 
#. As the instructor breaks the threshold of the doorway, the instructor will command, “CARRY ON.” If the command is not given, the Cadet Flt/CC will give the “Carry on” command once the instructor has fully exited the room.

**Classroom Protocol**

* When a lecture is in session, or the same lesson will resume upon conclusion of the break, cadets will not call the room to attention when the instructor or a visitor (regardless of rank) enters or exits the room. This is considered an academic session and will continue uninterrupted.
* When a lecture is not in session, cadets will call the room to attention when a commissioned staff member enters or exits the room (provided there is not already a commissioned staff member in the room of equal or higher rank).
* As the officer breaks the threshold of the doorway, the first cadet to see the officer will call the room to attention.
