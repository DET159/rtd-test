Objective 3: AFROTC Honor Code
====

.. rst-class:: center

    **“We will not lie, steal, or cheat,** |br|
    **nor tolerate among us anyone who does.”**

The purpose of the Honor Code is to foster an environment based upon a personal sense of honesty and integrity. Implementation of the Honor Code means not only can you be trusted but that you also have the moral courage to confront those who violate these standards.
 
**Lying** |br|
Lying is any statement of untruth or omission of the truth, which is meant to deceive or mislead. One example of lying is intentionally signing in at an improper time in order to avoid a regulation violation.
 
**Stealing** |br|
Anyone who wrongfully takes, obtains, or withholds someone else's property without their permission, with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive another of such property, is guilty of stealing.
 
**Cheating** |br|
In essence, cheating is taking unfair advantage of another. Cheating violates the competitive sense of “fair play”. An example of cheating is not completing the minimum required push-ups during the Fitness Assessment, yet coercing your spotter to indicate otherwise or knowingly allow it to occur.
 
**Toleration** |br|
Toleration means the conditional acceptance of, or non-interference of, wrong-doings. If you know a cadet has lied, stolen, or cheated, and you fail to report or confront the matter, you may be guilty of toleration.
