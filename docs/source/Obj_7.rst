Fundamentals and Stationary Movements
------------------------

| **Position of Attention**

| Bring heels together and in line with each other, feet should be turned out equally forming a 45-degree angle. Keep legs straight without locking or bending the knees. Body is upright with hips level, chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders square/even. Arms hang straight down alongside the body. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first joint of the forefinger, along the seams of the trousers or sides of the skirt. Hands are cupped (but not clenched as a fist) with palms facing the leg. Chin can be drawn in so the head rests vertically on the neck. Eyes are to the front, caged, with parallel line of sight to the ground. Silence and immobility are required.


| **Parade Rest**

| The command is “Parade, REST”. On the command “REST”, raise the left foot just enough to clear the ground and move it to the left so your heels are 12 inches apart (as measured from the inside of the heels). Keep the legs straight, but not stiff, and the heels on line. Bring the arms, fully extended, to the back of the body. With palms outward, the tip of the right middle finger should rest on the tip of the left middle finger. The palms will face outwards. Place the right hand in the palm of the left, right thumb over the left to form an “X”. Keep head and eyes straight ahead, and remain silent and immobile.


| **At Ease**

| The command is “AT EASE”. On the command “AT EASE”, relax in a standing position, but keep the right foot in place. Position in the formation will not change, and silence will be maintained.


| **Rest**

| The command is “REST”. On the command “REST”, the same requirements for at ease apply, but moderate speech is permitted.


|**Fall Out**

| The command is “FALL OUT”. On the command “FALL OUT”, individuals may relax in a standing position or break ranks. They must remain in the immediate area, and no specific method of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is permitted.


| **Resuming Position of Attention**

| To resume the position of attention from any of the rests (except fall out), the command is (for example) “Flight, ATTENTION”. On the command Flight, assume the position of parade rest; and at the command “ATTENTION”, assume the position of attention.


| **Facing Movements**

| Execute facing movements from a halt, at the position of attention, and in the cadence of quick time. Perform facing movements in two counts.

| **Right (Left) Face:** The commands are “Right (Left), FACE”. On the command “FACE”, raise the right (left) toe and left (right) heel slightly and pivot 90 degrees to the right (left) on the ball of the left (right) foot and the heel of the right (left) foot, assisted by slight pressure on the ball of the left (right) foot. Keep legs straight, but not stiff. The upper portion of the body remains at attention. Next, bring the left (right) foot forward, ensuring heels are together and on line. Feet should now be forming a 45-degree angle.

| **About Face:** The command is “About, FACE”. On the command “FACE” lift the right foot and place the ball of the right foot approximately half a shoe length behind and slightly left of the left heel. Distribute weight to the ball of the right foot and heel of the left. Keeping the upper body at attention, pivot 180 degrees to the right on the ball of the right foot and the heel of the left. Suspend arm swing during the movement, and remain as though at attention. On completion of the pivot, heels should be together and on line and feet should form a 45-degree angle.

| **Half Right (Left) Face:** For 45-degree movements, the command Half Right (Left), FACE may be used. The procedures are identical to Left and Right Face but used 45-degree turns instead of 90-degree turns.


| **Present Arms/Order Arms**

| The commands are “Present, ARMS” and “Order ARMS”. On the command “PRESENT, ARMS”, Raise the right hand in the most direct manner while at the same time extending and joining the fingers. Keep the palm flat and facing the body. Place the thumb along the forefingers, keeping the palm flat and forming a straight line from fingertips to elbow. Tilt the palm slightly toward the face. Hold the upper arm horizontally. Ensure the tip of the middle finger touches the right front corner of headdress/glasses, or the outside corner of the right eyebrow. At the command “ORDER, ARMS”, return your hand to your side and resume the position of attention.

| **Dress Right Dress**

| **Normal Interval:** The commands are “Dress Right, DRESS” and “Ready, FRONT”. On the command “DRESS”, everyone except the last person in each element raises and extends the left arm laterally from the shoulder so the arm is parallel with the ground. As the arm is raised, un-cup the hand, keeping the palm down. Extend and join the fingers and place the thumb along the forefinger. At the same time as the left arm is raised, each individual (except the guide and element leaders) turns head and eyes 45-degrees to the right with snap. The leading individual of each file establishes normal interval (by taking small choppy steps and aligning with the base file) and establishes exact shoulder-to-fingertip contact with the individual to the immediate right. The second, third, and fourth element leaders align themselves directly behind the person in front of them (using small choppy steps) and visually establish a 40-inch distance. As the remaining members align themselves behind the individual in front of or to the right of them, their shoulders may or may not touch the fingertips of the individual to their right. If the arm is too long, place the extended hand behind the shoulder of the individual to the left. If the arm is too short, leave it extended toward the individual to the left and parallel to the ground. Once dress, cover, interval, and distance (DCID) have been established, the command Ready, FRONT will be given. On this command, Airmen whose arms are up will lower their arms with snap to their sides (without slapping their sides) and re-cup their hands when their arm is at approximately waist level. As the arm is lowered, Airmen whose heads are turned will return their heads to the front with snap. The body is now back to the position of attention.

| **Close Interval:** The command is At Close Interval, Dress Right, DRESS. On this command, all Airmen except the last one in each element will raise their left hand so the heel of the hand rests on the left hip, fingers are extended and joined, thumb is along the forefinger, fingertips point toward the ground, and the elbow in line with the body. At the same time the left hand is raised, all Airmen except the guide and second, third, and fourth element leaders will turn their head and eyes 45 degrees to the right. First element Airmen establish the interval by ensuring their upper right arm touches the extended elbow of the individual to their right. The same procedures used to establish DCID for normal interval will be used for close interval. At Close Interval, Dress Right (Left), DRESS is not given to a flight at normal interval, and Dress Right (Left), DRESS is not given to a flight at close interval

Basic Flight Drill
--------------------

| **Line and Inverted Line Formation**

A flight forms in at least two, but not more than four, elements in line formation. The command is FALL IN. ::

**Column and Inverted Column Formation**
 
| A flight forms in at least two, but not more than four, elements in line formation. The command is FALL IN.

|**Cover**

| **Column Formation:** To align the flight in column, the command is COVER. On this command, everyone except the guide adjusts by taking small choppy steps if needed and establishes dress, cover, interval, and distance. The leading individual of each file (excluding the base file) obtains the proper interval (normal or close). The base file, the file on which a movement is planned, regulated, or aligned, establishes and maintains a 40-inch distance. All others align themselves beside the individual to their right and behind the individual in front of them.


**Inverted Column Formation:** (GENERALLY NOT RECOMMENDED). The same command and procedures used to reestablish dress, cover, interval, and distance while in column formation are used in inverted column. The exception to this is the leading individual of the base element does not move and everyone else establishes dress, cover, interval, and distance based on this individual. ::

| **Forward March**

| To march forward from a halt, the command is “FORWARD, MARCH”. On the command “MARCH”, step off straight ahead with the left foot, taking a 24- inch step (measured from heel to heel), and place the heel on the ground first. Use coordinated arm swing: right arm forward with the left leg and left arm forward with the right leg. Cup the hands with the thumbs pointed down, hang arms straight but not stiff and swing the arms naturally. Measure the swing 6 inches to the front (measured from the rear of the hand to the front of the thigh) and 3 inches to the rear (measured from the front of the hand to the back of the thigh). If applicable, maintain proper dress, cover, interval, and distance and adhere to cadence. Count cadence as follows: “HUP, TOOP, THREEP, FOURP”. One and Three should be on the left foot with two and four on the right. The pattern is called twice (8 beats) with a rest of 8 beats in between (8 on 8 off).
 
| **Halt**

| To halt from quick time, the command is “FLIGHT, HALT”, given as either foot strikes the ground. On the command “HALT”, take one more 24-inch step. Next, the trailing foot will be brought alongside the front foot. The heels will be together, on line, and form a 45-degree angle. Coordinated arm swing will cease as the weight of the body shifts to the leading foot when halting. “COVER” should be called immediately after.
 
| **Mark-Time**

| The command is “Mark Time, MARCH”. When marching, the command “MARCH” is given as either foot strikes the ground. Take one more 24-inch step with the right (left) foot and then bring the trailing foot to a position so both heels are on line. The cadence is continued by alternately raising and lowering each foot. The balls of the feet are raised 4 inches above the ground. Normal arm swing is maintained.

| To resume marching, the command “Forward, MARCH” is given as the heel of the left foot strikes the ground. The Airman takes one more step in place and then steps off in a full 24-inch step with the left foot.
